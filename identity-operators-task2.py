# Check if the two lists are identical in terms of their content, regardless of order.

# to compare two lists, use if (A) is (B): / else:

submitted = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
attended = ["Charlie", "Eve", "Alice", "Frank"]

if (submitted) is (attended):
    print("Huzzah! The two lists are identical in terms of their content, regardless of order.")

else:

# There were no instructions to print - they're just included to check if the code works as expected.
